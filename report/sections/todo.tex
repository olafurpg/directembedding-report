There are two areas which require more work.
Firstly, it would be interesting to see more Directembedding case studies on other domains besides slick.
In particular, it would be interesting to see how useful Directembedding is to design a deep EDSL from scratch.
Secondly, although our initial experience with slick-direct is positive, we belive that the library requires more thorough evaluation to be considered as a viable alternative to the lifted embedding DSL.
