\section{Case study: slick-direct} % (fold)
\label{sec:CaseStudy}
We evaluated Directembedding by implementing a front-end, \emph{slick-direct}, for the widely adopted Scala library \emph{Slick}.
Professional Scala consultancies such as \href{http://underscore.io}{underscore.io} offer public and private training on Slick and underscore.io even recently released a book about the library\footnote{http://underscore.io/training/courses/essential-slick/}.
The hefty prices on the private training indicates that there is commercial interest in using Slick.
The fact that the book is close to 300 pages may also indicate that the library has a steep learning curve.
